# Web-Gphoto2-CropperJs
The integration in angular of Web-Gphoto2 and cropperJs took me some time I would have spared finding the components online so here is the minimal example of the components I made.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.1.
The CSS of the crop.component.css  is from [cropperJs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs) the additional styling of the components is [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
## Development Server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
